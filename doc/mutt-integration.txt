Integrating sinntp with mutt
============================

Since sinntp stores newsgroups in mboxes, adding them to mutt is simple, see
description of ``mailboxes`` command in Mutt documentation for details. 

Posting to newsgroups requires adding folder hooks:

::
    folder-hook . unmy_hdr To
    folder-hook . unset sendmail

    `for group in ${SINNTP_HOME:-$HOME/.sinntp}/*; do \
        group="$(basename $group | cut -d@ -f1)"; \
        echo -n folder-hook \"^${group}$\" \" \
            my_hdr To: $group \; \
            set sendmail=\'nntp-push -p strip_headers\' \
        \"\; ; \
    done`

Please pay attention to ``sendmail`` variable since it's unset in folder-hook
which matches all folder names. You may want to set a default value there.

``autoedit`` variable is also worth noticing when posting to newsgroups since
``To:`` header is added automatically in above configuration.
