sinntp (1.3)

  Support for $SINNTP_HOME environment variable was dropped in favor of
  respecting the XDG Base Directory Specification. If there is no
  $XDG_DATA_HOME variable set, sinntp stores its data in
  $HOME/.local/share/sinntp. You should move existing .sinntp directory to the
  new location before invoking a new version of sinntp. Support for the old
  location will be completely dropped in the next major release (2.0).
